## COVID-19 Global Data Tracker


The goal of this project is to conduct a study on the Covid-19 pandemic in the world and in specific countries. The countries I chose were Rwanda (my current country) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (the country where I was born and raised).

For the purpose, I have build a data analysis
that tracks global COVID-19 trends. A notebook showcasing this is included.

So we'll analyze cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations countries and time.

The method I followed was first to use the [owid-covid-data.csv](./owid-covid-data.csv) file as the dataset from which our analysis will be conducted .

I have created a new jupyter notebook in which , I will read the csv file, import the needed modules for reading the file, be able to made my analysis and find correlations, and visualitions also.

**Modules used**

I have imported:

- **Pandas:**  which is a Python package used for data manipulation, reading and analysis.

* **Seaborn:** Helps for data visualization. It works with matplotlib.

+ **Numpy:** this modules helps to perform many operations mainly mathematical operations.

- **matplotlib.pyplot:** needed for data visualization.


The project can be viewed in the jupyter file [pythonWeek8Project](./pythonWeek8Project.ipynb).



here we can see the imported modules, how to read the csv file in which we can read the name of the columns of the dataframe.
From that some analysis were made like checking the missing values for each column.
I did a research concerning specific countries in order to know the total cases over time for these countries, their daily new cases, the total deaths over time and performed chart representation or visualization for a better and easier understanding.

this analysis shows a calculation of the death rate meaning meaning the total of death per total of cases.

There is also a visualization of the rate of new cases of contamination and this according to the various regions of the world.

The study also shows visualizations regarding vaccinations in specific countries.

First for :'Rwanda' and 'Uganda' 

then for : 'Rwanda', 'Uganda','United States' and 'India'.
