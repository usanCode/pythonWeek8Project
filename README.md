## COVID-19 Global Data Tracker


The goal of this project is to conduct a study on the Covid-19 pandemic in the world and in specific countries. The countries I chose were Rwanda (my current country) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (the country where I was born and raised).

For the purpose, I have build a data analysis
that tracks global COVID-19 trends. A notebook showcasing this is included.

So we'll analyze cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations countries and time.
